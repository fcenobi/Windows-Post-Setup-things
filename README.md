# Windows Post Setup
This is a collection of executibles, registry edits, etc. that are to be ran after installing a copy of Windows. Typically, I will run these after I'm done installing updates and drivers.

Scripts, executables, and etc. come from these sources:

These lists are by no means comprehensive. It is totally possible there are better tools out there, or tools I am missing.
